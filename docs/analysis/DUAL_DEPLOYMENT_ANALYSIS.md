# üìä ANALYSIS: 15 ACCOUNTS WITH SPLIT SESSIONS

**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Scenario:** 15 accounts, 6-8 hours daily, split sessions, different schedules

---

## üîç **CURRENT RATE LIMIT ANALYSIS FOR 15 ACCOUNTS:**

### **TikTok API Limits:**
```
- Per Minute: 10 requests maximum
- Per Hour: 60 requests maximum  
- Per Day: 120 requests maximum
```

### **15 Accounts with Current Config (60 min interval):**
```
Total accounts: 15
Check interval: 60 minutes (24 checks per day)
Daily requests: 15 √ó 24 = 360 requests

Status: ‚ùå EXTREMELY UNSAFE
- Exceeds daily limit by: 240 requests (300% over limit)
- Risk: IMMEDIATE RATE LIMITING
```

---

## üéØ **STREAMING SCHEDULE ANALYSIS:**

### **Typical Live Schedule Pattern:**
```
6 AM - 2 PM (8 hours): Morning/Day streamers (7-8 accounts)
6 PM - 2 AM (8 hours): Evening/Night streamers (7-8 accounts)
2 AM - 6 AM (4 hours): Late night (few accounts, 1-3)
```

### **Peak Overlap Times:**
```
6-8 AM: Transition (3-5 accounts live)
6-8 PM: Peak time (10-12 accounts live)
10 PM-12 AM: Prime time (8-10 accounts live)
```

---

## üöÄ **SOLUTION: DUAL DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Deployment A: Morning/Day Shift**
```
Accounts: 8 accounts (morning/day streamers)
Schedule focus: 6 AM - 6 PM
Autochecker interval: 90 minutes
Daily requests: 8 √ó 16 = 128 requests
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è SLIGHTLY OVER (but manageable)
```

### **Deployment B: Evening/Night Shift**
```
Accounts: 7 accounts (evening/night streamers)
Schedule focus: 6 PM - 6 AM
Autochecker interval: 90 minutes  
Daily requests: 7 √ó 16 = 112 requests
Status: ‚úÖ SAFE (within 120 limit)
```

---

## üìã **RECOMMENDED ACCOUNT DISTRIBUTION:**

### **Deployment A - Day Shift (8 accounts):**
```
tiramisu_dance     # Active 7 AM - 3 PM
glow_babies1       # Active 8 AM - 4 PM  
firedance.fd       # Active 9 AM - 5 PM
sky_weeekly        # Active 10 AM - 6 PM
cocoberrygirls     # Active 6 AM - 2 PM
nova_deluna        # Active 11 AM - 7 PM
kravenboys         # Active 8 AM - 4 PM
pufflegirls3       # Active 9 AM - 5 PM
```

### **Deployment B - Night Shift (7 accounts):**
```
soul_sisters1000   # Active 7 PM - 3 AM
fire_dance03       # Active 8 PM - 4 AM
1908_sky_light     # Active 9 PM - 5 AM
vortexspark_dance  # Active 6 PM - 2 AM
babyblue.001       # Active 10 PM - 6 AM
redbomb_dance      # Active 8 PM - 4 AM
velora.girlss      # Active 11 PM - 7 AM
```

## üîß **OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION:**

### **For Both Deployments:**
```env
# Increased interval to fit within limits
AUTO_CHECKER_INTERVAL=5400000  # 90 minutes

# Conservative rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=5
RATE_LIMIT_REQUEST_DELAY=2500
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR=40

# Schedule-aware checking
PEAK_HOURS_ENABLED=true
PEAK_HOURS_START=18  # 6 PM
PEAK_HOURS_END=24    # 12 AM
PEAK_HOURS_INTERVAL=3600000  # 60 min during peak
OFF_PEAK_INTERVAL=7200000    # 120 min during off-peak
```

---

## üìä **RATE LIMIT CALCULATIONS:**

### **Deployment A (Day - 8 accounts):**
```
Peak hours (6 AM - 6 PM): 12 hours
Off-peak hours: 12 hours

Peak checks: 8 accounts √ó 12 checks = 96 requests
Off-peak checks: 8 accounts √ó 6 checks = 48 requests
Total daily: 96 + 48 = 144 requests

Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è SLIGHTLY OVER (but distributed across 24 hours)
```

### **Deployment B (Night - 7 accounts):**
```
Peak hours (6 PM - 6 AM): 12 hours  
Off-peak hours: 12 hours

Peak checks: 7 accounts √ó 12 checks = 84 requests
Off-peak checks: 7 accounts √ó 6 checks = 42 requests
Total daily: 84 + 42 = 126 requests

Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è SLIGHTLY OVER but manageable
```

---

## ‚ö° **SMART SCHEDULING APPROACH:**

### **Adaptive Interval Based on Schedule:**
```javascript
// Pseudocode for smart scheduling
function getOptimalInterval(currentHour, accountSchedules) {
    const activeAccounts = accountSchedules.filter(acc => 
        acc.isLiveTime(currentHour)
    ).length;
    
    if (activeAccounts > 8) {
        return 7200000; // 2 hours when many live
    } else if (activeAccounts > 4) {
        return 5400000; // 90 minutes moderate
    } else {
        return 3600000; // 60 minutes when few live
    }
}
```

### **Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Focuses checking when accounts are likely live
- ‚úÖ Reduces unnecessary checks during sleep hours
- ‚úÖ Optimizes rate limit usage
- ‚úÖ Better coverage during active hours

---

## üéØ **FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**

### **Option 1: Conservative Dual Deployment (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Deployment A: 6 accounts, 90-minute interval
Daily requests: 6 √ó 16 = 96 requests ‚úÖ SAFE

Deployment B: 6 accounts, 90-minute interval  
Daily requests: 6 √ó 16 = 96 requests ‚úÖ SAFE

Total coverage: 12 accounts (80% of target)
Remaining: 3 accounts manually monitored
```

### **Option 2: Aggressive Dual Deployment (RISKY)**
```
Deployment A: 8 accounts, 90-minute interval
Deployment B: 7 accounts, 90-minute interval
Total coverage: 15 accounts (100% target)
Risk: Slight rate limiting during peak hours
```

### **Option 3: Single Deployment with Smart Rotation**
```
Single deployment: 5 accounts active at any time
Rotation pool: 15 accounts total
Rotation every 4 hours: 3 rotations per day
Daily requests: 5 √ó 24 = 120 requests ‚úÖ PERFECT FIT
Coverage: All 15 accounts monitored throughout day
```

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:**

### **Phase 1: Start with Option 1 (Conservative)**
1. Deploy A with 6 morning accounts
2. Deploy B with 6 evening accounts  
3. Monitor performance and rate limits
4. Manual check remaining 3 accounts

### **Phase 2: If successful, upgrade to Option 2**
1. Add 2 more accounts to Deployment A
2. Add 1 more account to Deployment B
3. Monitor rate limiting closely
4. Implement adaptive intervals if needed

### **Phase 3: Future - Smart Rotation System**
1. Implement account rotation logic
2. Single deployment with 15-account pool
3. Optimal rate limit utilization
4. Maximum coverage with safety

## ‚úÖ **ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:**

### **1. 15 accounts with current rules - Rate limit sufficient?**
‚ùå **NO** - 360 daily requests vs 120 limit (300% over)

### **2. Dual deployment for day/night shifts - Possible?**
‚úÖ **YES** - Recommended approach with optimizations:
- Deployment A: 6-8 day accounts (96-128 requests)
- Deployment B: 6-7 night accounts (96-112 requests)
- Both slightly over but manageable with smart scheduling

### **3. Recommended approach?**
üéØ **OPTION 1** (Conservative) initially, then upgrade to **OPTION 3** (Smart Rotation) for optimal coverage.

**START CONSERVATIVE, THEN SCALE UP! üöÄ**
