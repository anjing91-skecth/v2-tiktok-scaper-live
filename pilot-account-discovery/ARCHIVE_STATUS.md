## üö® PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED PROJECT üö®

**Project Name:** TikTok Account Discovery Pilot  
**Archive Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Final Status:** DISCONTINUED - Technical Infeasibility  

## Quick Summary
This pilot project attempted to create an automated TikTok account discovery system for dance groups and agencies. After extensive testing of 8+ libraries and approaches, the project was discontinued due to:

1. **TikTok Anti-Bot Protection** - Too strong for reliable automation
2. **Login Requirements** - Keyword search blocked without authentication
3. **Zero Target Accuracy** - 0% success rate for target dance groups
4. **High Cost, Low ROI** - Commercial APIs cost $100-500/month with limited results
