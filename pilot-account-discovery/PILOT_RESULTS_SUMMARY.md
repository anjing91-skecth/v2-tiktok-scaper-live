# PILOT PROJECT RESULTS SUMMARY

## Project: TikTok Account Discovery & Curation
**Status: DISCONTINUED** ‚ùå  
**Date: July 3, 2025**

## Quick Summary
After extensive testing of 8+ TikTok scraping libraries and approaches, the project has been discontinued due to technical limitations and insufficient ROI.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Worked
- **Live Feed Scraping:** 20-50 accounts per run
- **Basic Automation:** Puppeteer-based browser automation
- **No Authentication:** Works without TikTok login

### ‚ùå What Failed
- **Keyword Search:** Blocked by login requirements
- **Group Detection:** 0% accuracy for dance groups/agencies
- **Scaling:** Rate limiting and anti-bot measures
- **Cost Efficiency:** Premium APIs too expensive ($100-500/month)

### üîß Requires Investment
- **RapidAPI:** $50-200/month, limited functionality
- **Apify:** $100-500/month, still restricted

## Technical Results
| Library | Status | Users Found | Groups Found | Cost |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Simple Scraper | ‚úÖ Working | 22 | 0 | Free |
| Live Feed Engine | ‚úÖ Working | 50+ | 0 | Free |
| RapidAPI | üîß Needs Setup | 25* | 5* | $50-200/mo |
| TikTokAPI Python | ‚ùå Failed | 0 | 0 | Free |
| tiktok-scraper | ‚ùå Failed | 0 | 0 | Free |

*Simulated results

## Bottom Line
- **Live feed scraping works** but only gives random streamers
- **Targeted search (by keywords)** is blocked by TikTok
- **Dance group detection** accuracy is 0%
- **Cost vs value** doesn't justify continued development

## Recommendation
**Switch to manual curation or other platforms (Instagram/YouTube) for dance community discovery.**
