# TikTok Account Discovery Pilot - ARCHIVED

⚠️ **PROJECT STATUS: DISCONTINUED** ⚠️

This directory contains the archived results of a pilot project to develop automated TikTok account discovery and curation system, specifically targeting dance groups and agencies.

## Project Closure Summary
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Status:** DISCONTINUED  
**Reason:** Technical limitations and insufficient ROI  
**Decision:** Project archived, no further development

## Final Results
- ✅ **Live Feed Scraping:** Works (20-50 accounts/run) - but random streamers only
- ❌ **Keyword Search:** Blocked by TikTok login requirements  
- ❌ **Group Detection:** 0% accuracy for target dance groups/agencies
- 🔧 **API Solutions:** Too expensive ($100-500/month) for limited results

## Key Findings
1. **TikTok Anti-Bot Protection:** Too strong for reliable automation
2. **Login Requirements:** Keyword search requires authenticated sessions
3. **Group Detection:** Requires video content analysis (not feasible with current approach)
4. **Cost vs Value:** Commercial APIs too expensive for expected ROI

## Archive Documentation
- [`PILOT_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md`](PILOT_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md) - Executive summary
- [`docs/PROJECT_DISCONTINUATION_REPORT.md`](docs/PROJECT_DISCONTINUATION_REPORT.md) - Full technical report
- [`docs/FINAL_LIBRARY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](docs/FINAL_LIBRARY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md) - Detailed library analysis
- [`docs/LIBRARY_RESEARCH.md`](docs/LIBRARY_RESEARCH.md) - Research methodology and findings

## What Was Tested (8+ Libraries/Approaches)
- ✅ **Simple Scraper (Puppeteer):** 22 users found, 0 target groups
- ✅ **Live Feed Engine:** 50+ users found, 0 target groups  
- ❌ **TikTokAPI Python:** Installation/dependency issues
- ❌ **tiktok-scraper:** 0 results (deprecated/blocked)
- ❌ **Playwright-stealth:** Package conflicts
- 🔧 **RapidAPI:** Requires $50-200/month subscription
- 🔧 **Apify:** Requires $100-500/month subscription

## Final Recommendation
**❌ TikTok automated discovery is not feasible for dance groups/agencies**

**Alternative approaches:**
- **Manual VA curation:** ~$500-1000/month (most cost-effective)
- **Instagram API:** Better hashtag discovery for dance communities
- **YouTube API:** Public API with dance channel search capabilities
- **Community-driven discovery:** Social media engagement strategies
