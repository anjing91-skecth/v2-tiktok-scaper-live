# TikTok Login Requirement - Solutions Strategy

## Problem
TikTok now requires login to access live stream content, which blocks our automated account discovery system.

## Confirmed Issues
- ‚úÖ Home page access blocked without login
- ‚úÖ Live search pages require authentication  
- ‚úÖ Mobile version also requires login
- ‚úÖ Guest browsing is limited or unavailable

## Solution Approaches

- Implement automated login flow
- Handle 2FA and CAPTCHA
- Session management and rotation

### 2. üç™ Session Cookie Management
**Pros:** Avoids repeated logins
**Cons:** Cookies expire, harder to maintain
**Implementation:**
- Manual login once to get cookies
- Save and reuse session cookies
- Refresh cookies before expiration
- Multiple account cookie rotation

### 3. üåê Proxy + Residential IP Rotation
**Pros:** Appears more like real users
**Cons:** Cost, complexity, still need accounts
**Implementation:**
- Use residential proxy services
- Rotate IPs and user agents
- Distribute requests across proxies
- Combined with session management

### 4. üì± Mobile App API Reverse Engineering
**Pros:** More stable than web scraping
**Cons:** Complex, may violate ToS, needs updates
**Implementation:**
- Analyze TikTok mobile app API calls
- Implement API client
- Handle authentication tokens
- Monitor for API changes

### 5. üé≠ Human-like Browser Automation
**Pros:** Harder to detect as bot
**Cons:** Slower, still needs accounts
**Implementation:**
- Random mouse movements and scrolling
- Variable timing between actions  
- Human-like browsing patterns
- Account warming strategies

### 6. üîß Alternative Data Sources
**Pros:** No TikTok blocking issues
**Cons:** Less comprehensive, may be outdated
**Implementation:**
- Social media monitoring tools
- Third-party TikTok analytics APIs
- Influencer marketing platforms
- Manual curation with automation assist
